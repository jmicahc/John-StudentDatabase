    ***Note*** this is very imperfect. Really should use a datetime
    object, but that object can't reprepresent date as DD/MM/YYYY.
    The current regex matches illegal dates, such as 99/99/9999.
    I'm not sure how to catch all the illegal dates with a regex,
    especially since legal days are dependent on the month.

           string to represent a date formatted as
           DD/MM/YYYY.

        - string
           Same string as the input string. Returned only if
           the string matches a regex string. Otherwise, a
           value error is returned.
